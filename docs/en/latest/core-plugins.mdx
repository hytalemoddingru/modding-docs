## Summary
How plugins are discovered, loaded, and managed by the core server.

## Plugin discovery
- Core plugins are registered at boot
- External plugins are loaded from mods/ and optional directories
- Builtin plugins can be bundled next to the server

## Lifecycle
- PluginManager runs setup and start phases
- Load order is resolved from dependencies
- Plugin state is tracked via PluginState

## Classloading
- Core plugins use a shared PluginClassLoader
- External plugins are isolated per path
- Early plugins can transform classes before boot
